This tool analyzes the code and detects   potential vulnerabilities. Some of the key features of Bandit are its ease of   use, its ability to integrate with other tools, and its support for multiple   Python versions. If you want to know about bandit you can check its   documentation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finds unused code: Vulture   is useful for cleaning up and finding errors in large code bases in   Python.</p> </li> <li> <p>Complexity of functions and modules: We use   McCabe to identify the complexity in our   Python code that may be difficult to maintain or understand. By identifying   complex code at the outset, we as developers can refactor it to make it easier   to maintain and understand. In summary, McCabe helps us to improve the quality   of our code and make it easier to maintain. If you would like to learn more   about McCabe and code complexity, you can visit McCabe - Code Complexity   Checker.   This tool is included with Flake8.</p> </li> <li> <p>TODO</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#credits","title":"Credits","text":"<p>This package was created with Cookieninja and the osl-incubator/scicookie project template.</p>"},{"location":"changelog/","title":"Release Notes","text":""},{"location":"changelog/#041-2024-01-19","title":"0.4.1 (2024-01-19)","text":""},{"location":"changelog/#bug-fixes","title":"Bug Fixes","text":"<ul> <li>Fix dependencies (#16) (0f0feec)</li> <li>Update dependencies (#17) (fb1303e)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"changelog/#release-notes_1","title":"Release Notes","text":""},{"location":"changelog/#040-2023-09-04","title":"0.4.0 (2023-09-04)","text":""},{"location":"changelog/#features","title":"Features","text":"<ul> <li>add option for downloading from youtube with a specific resolution.

It allows us to easily manage dependencies, virtual environments and package versions. Poetry also includes features such as dependency resolution, lock files and publishing to PyPI. Overall, Poetry streamlines the process of managing Python packages, making it easier for us to create and share our code with others.</p> <p>Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!
